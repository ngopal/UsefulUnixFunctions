These are small, useful scripts I like to keep in my main PATH.

transpose.sh - transposes a text file

Functions I'm planning to include here in the future:

sum.sh - sum up a column
mean.sh - find the mean of a column
median.sh - find the median of a column
max.sh - find the maximum value of a column
min.sh - find the minimum value of a column
