These are small, useful scripts I like to keep in my main PATH.

transpose.sh - transposes a text file
sum.sh - sum up a column
mean.sh - find the mean of a column
max.sh - find the maximum value of a column
min.sh - find the minimum value of a column
stats.sh - in addition to the mean, it also reports the median, standard deviation, average deviation, variance, skew, and kurtosis
reverse.sh - reverses a column

Functions I'm planning to include here in the future:

median.sh - find the median of a column
