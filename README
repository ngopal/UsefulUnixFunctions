These are small, useful scripts I like to keep in my main PATH.

transpose.sh - transposes a text file
sum.sh - sum up a column
mean.sh - find the mean of a column
max.sh - find the maximum value of a column
min.sh - find the minimum value of a column
median.sh - find the median of a column
stats.sh - in addition to the mean, it also reports the median, standard deviation, average deviation, variance, skew, and kurtosis
reverse.sh - reverses a column

Install instructions:
1. Assumes install is in the home directory. Just cd to your home directory and perform a git clone on my repo.

git clone git@github.com:ngopal/UsefulUnixFunctions.git

2. Edit your ./bash_profile or ./bashrc to add the UsefulUnixFunctions directory to your PATH:

export PATH = $PATH:~/UsefulUnixFunctions/bin

3. Create alias commands to the scripts if you wish (also done in your bash profile or bashrc).
